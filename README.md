# Survey Project

Survey Project, PROJECT FIVE, by C. Ã–berg & F. Cassisa

We made a Survey to check the readiness of future freelancer in Javascript. By replying questions, we provide at the end not only a Summary but tips based on which replies they have given.

This project has been tough on the logic aspect. There are different components passing data and logic that is intertwined among different elements.

### The Problem

After deciding what should have the Survey be based on, we structured the initial part together. Then we worked adding complexity and elements to structure more and more the Survey towards the stretched goals. We branched out when needed. Some difficulties appeared when many variables in the logic have been added. If we had had more time, we would have maybe refactored better and defined what would be our end features in order to have a better plan from the beginning.
